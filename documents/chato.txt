Exceptions to the Right to Disconnect 
TCS is a Global organization, and its operations are spread over 55+countries having different time zones. If an associate must work with stakeholders (associates, customers, partners or others) from other countries having different time zones, they must be aware that may be required to work outside of their contractual time in order to collaborate effectively, and overtime payment will be applied accordingly. Efforts must be based by managers and employees to suitable adjust working hours, keeping in mind both the principles of Right to Disconnect as well as different time zones we operate in.
TCS reserves the right to interrupt leaves, vacation, or rest periods, in situations permitted as per law, specially in cases of force majeure or fortuitous events in which associates may be required to full fix extra duties I'd at work to enable business continuity to resolution of difficult or urgent situation in the operation of TCS. Such work rendered is eligible to be compensated under the prevailing Overtime and/or On-Call policies as applicable for countries.
